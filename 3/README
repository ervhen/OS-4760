	I hard coded the filenames, so the list of pals is list and it outputs nopalin.out and palin.out. The children append to the files so if you care about the outputs they need to be deleted between runs. Everything else works as it should. I didnt include any options for the prog, since it wasnt required. The highest amount of simultaneous children processes is 15. I didnt change the file names so its thing.c and test.c. Testing later as i am about to turn it in results in a segfault saying that strncpy is misalligned, I am hoping its because of all of the allocated shared mem atm I didnt change anything and it was fine.
